        <title>Give production terminal sessions a unique background colour</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;About six months after I started my current job, the first one I’ve had that involves regular contact with production servers and live databases, I spotted this great hint-disguised-as-a-cautionary-tale from &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/honeststatuspage&quot;&gt;@HonestStatusPage&lt;/a&gt;: 
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/terminal_colour/terminal_tweet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Being positive first, know that our production shells now have a red background for easy visual recognition. Now, about your data...&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before my current job, I’d been working mostly on a freelance basis on mostly front-end-ish projects. My work involved a lot of files, a lot of source control, and only local servers &amp;amp; databases. In my new role, closer to the metal of the production servers, I was living with the quiet haunting fear of mistaking a production terminal session for development or staging, and doing something absent-minded, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gitlabstatus/status/826591961444384768&quot;&gt;catastrophic results&lt;/a&gt;. I was careful, but I still worried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, giving each server environment a clear visual cue in the form of a background colour was a great idea to implement BEFORE any disasters occured. I decided to set up an orange background for my staging environment, and a red one for production. It turned out to be straightforward &amp;amp; I’ve been glad for it ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;give-different-environments-their-own-terminal-background-colours&quot;&gt;Give different environments their own Terminal background colours&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Create two new profiles in Terminal &amp;gt; Preferences &amp;gt; Profiles by clicking the + button at the bottom of the profile list. Give each one a name and a background colour. I chose “Production” and “Staging”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/terminal_colour/custom_profiles.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shows the Terminal profile editor with a list of profile names. Arrows point towards the ones named Production and Staging&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) To use one of your new profiles right away, type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tabc profile_name&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tabc Production&lt;/code&gt; should now turn the background of the window red. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tabc Staging&lt;/code&gt; should turn it orange. Typing just &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tabc&lt;/code&gt; will reset it to the default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you don’t want to have to do this manually each time you SSH into Production- a better idea is to set this up in an alias you will use to do your logins, so that it’s automatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Edit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt; to create aliases to set the terminal profile by name, run the usual SSH command for that server, and switch back to the default terminal profile when the session has ended:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;sublime ~/.bash_profile

Add these lines the file: 

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ssh_staging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;tabc Staging; ssh secret@secret.staging.com -p 123456; tabc&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;alias &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ssh_production&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;tabc Production; ssh secret@secret.production.com -p 654321; tabc&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Reload your bash_profile either by typing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;source ~/.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt; or by closing &amp;amp; reopening the Terminal tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ssh_staging&lt;/code&gt;: You should now have an orange terminal window. Exit your SSH session. You should be back to your default terminal window colour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/terminal_colour/echo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Command prompt shows &#39;echo &amp;quot;I am a distinct colour that is less likely to be mistaken for a local environment&amp;quot;&#39;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m now a whole lot less worried about distracted terminal commands than I once was, because I have a strong visual cue of which environment I’m in.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Notes from the Three Capes Track</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hike/blade.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Walking out to The Blade&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sitting on a wooden bench on a verandah on what feels like the edge of the world. The jagged, towering coastline I’ll be walking tomorrow stretches off ahead of me. Behind me, the hut kitchen, and the sounds of handfuls of kids and their parents playing board games. The social side of the walk- being in a group of strangers at the huts at the start and end of each day- is a little tedious. I want to be in this wild and beautiful place with less company, and enjoy it quietly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But out on the track I mostly am alone, and have a lot of time to look at things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before I sat down to start writing this we saw a pair of sea eagles, recognisable by their huge size and white bellies, come swooping up the side of the cliff we’re perched on, then dive again, off and out of sight. Among the rocks between the verandah and the cliff edge I can see a tiny, brilliantly blue fairy wren hopping about, as adorable and perfectly round as one of the long-tailed tits we exclaim about in Sweden. Every now and then it spots its reflection in the window and flutters angrily up to attack the glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped for lunch today at a spot called Jurassic Crack. It was a ledge of rock overlooking a towering, sheer cliff face formed from these startlingly straight columns of a dark rock called Jurassic dolerite. It was pouring rain but we sat for a long time, admiring the view, eating tuna on damp crackers, trying to get photos that would do the whole towering drama of it some justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long after that we crossed a huge wind-swept moorland covered in dense, low brush. I stopped periodically to listen to the birds, but it took ages before I managed to spot one. A tiny brown darting thing, which I think i’ve just identified as a ‘striated field wren’ from the field guide to Tasmanian birds that is present at each hut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bush smells warm and spicy from the rain that’s fallen and the sun that’s come out now. Eucalyptus and tea tree mostly. It was alright to be walking in the rain this morning, except when we were up on the windy, freezing peaks- then it was a little desperate. Down in the forest it was nice, cloudy and gentle after the glaring bright sun of yesterday’s walk from the beach to the first hut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hike/boardwalk.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Boardwalk&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the plane from Hobart to Sydney, starting to make my way back home now. The day after I wrote the first part, we walked out to that thin, tall spit of rock called The Blade. We woke up early to catch the sun rising above the thin band of cloud on the horizon. Wedge-tailed eagles (“look for the ‘fingers’ stretching out from the wings”, said the ranger the night before when we asked how to tell the wedge-tails from the sea eagles) soared the cliffs in the weak golden light. We were the first walkers out on the track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our early start might be the reason why, not far out of camp, we came across an echidna head down in a tree stump, scrabbling for ants right beside the track. It’s a lifetime dream to see one so close and so unbothered by us- neither moving away nor defensively curled, just digging calmly for ants with its spiky blonde bum in the air like we weren’t there at all. We watched it for a long time, and photographed it from all angles, before moving on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bush out across Cape Pillar towards The Blade was dense scrub that gave way to barer, windswept patches, and on the ocean side to a few wonderful sloping wetlands. We saw many snakes, under rocks and just lingering by the track. In the valleys the enormous black cockatoos screeched and soared, and at the edges of the cliffs swallows dived up and down at incredible speeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of the ridge right before the track descended towards The Blade, the winds were truly ferocious. We’d been warned of gale-force, with gusts of 200km an hour, and up there the gusts had a solid, physical shove. Walking over that unprotected ridge- no fences, no railings, just a 300m drop to the ocean- my heart pounded like I was rock climbing or diving or some other terrifying physical sport. I told my sisters and myself that if I got scared, I’d just sit down, to make it harder for the wind to knock me over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the wind didn’t knock me over, and it grew a little calmer as we walked out onto The Blade. It’s a really incredibly piece of rock, no more than a few meters wide, extending straight up and out of the ocean and growing both taller and narrower towards the end, until you’re scrambling up bare rock with the long drop to the violent ocean visible just to each side of where you’re carefully placing your feet. And yet despite its narrowness and the wind and that dizzying drop, it felt secure enough that I kept choosing to go on and up, seating myself firmly whenever the wind gusted, shuffling from step to step, til I got to the very top. There’s only a few dense, twisted shrubs clinging to the rock up there, and spotted skinks darting in and out of the cracks. I saw one of them snatch a fat fly out of the air right where I was about to put my boot down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt like I took photos while I was up there- victory shots to try to capture that momentous grandeur somehow, and the spectacle of all that towering coastline in all directions- but I see now that I have only a few timid, quick shots of it. The truth is I was spooked by the wind and the height, and came quickly back down. The better photos are from the more secure ground back on the cape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little way down The Blade we came upon the first other hikers of the day, and gave them our wide-eyed and enthusiastic recommendation that they should try for a The Blade as long as the wind hadn’t picked up. Then we walked up and over the cape, back to the spectacular cliff top hut, and then with our full packs to a forest valley hut further along the trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hike/wallaby.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Boardwalk&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting off on the last walk of the track, a wallaby eating grass right by then boardwalk  spotted me and bounded off- further up the track, and resumed eating the grass. It looked outraged as I continued to walk up towards it, and bounded off again- about 20m up the track. We kept playing this game until the boardwalk gave way to gravel path, when it bounded off down some wallaby highway in the tall grass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beside the track every day we spotted wombat poo, although no wombats. Wombat poo is easy to spot because it’s oddly cubed, and they leave it over and over again in the same spot, preferring rocks and ledges. It’s like a gallery of poo of different vintages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hike/ferns.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Rainforest and tree ferns&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rainforest we climbed through to the modest peak of Mount Fortescue was some of the eeriest stuff i’ve ever seen. Small hikers among enormous tree-ferns, bright fungi, few birds, lots of leeches. Then over the mountain and back to the coastal scrub down towards Cape Huay. That was a long walk with a lot of stairs, and increasing numbers of unfamiliar faces- day hikers, coming in from our planned end point at Fortescue Bay. They smelled from meters away like perfume and soap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walking track out to the point was a narrow cut through the dense scrub, and in places the swallows used it as a runway, rocketing through at head-and-shoulder height with fearless speed and then looping off overhead. More skinks out on the Cape, and loads of fairy wrens. We ate our last hiking lunch out there, and I toasted my birthday with sticky lemon cupcakes I’d carried for 40km in a takeaway container. They were still good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the track the sun had come fully out, and despite the many warnings that it was impossibly cold, the shallow blue water of Fortescue Bay was looking inviting. I figured that after carrying my swimmers for 47km I should probably give it a go. We jumped in, and didn’t regret it. It was probably 16 degrees, and the prettiest body of water I think I’ve ever swum in. Unreal blue over white sand, and dark rocks at the edges to warm up on afterwards. Swimming in Sweden has taught me what’s so very good about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m finishing this in the departure lounge, Sydney-&amp;gt;Bangkok. I’ve stepped into the bland nowhereness of long-haul flying, and will soon emerge from it into what the weather app tells me will be a grey and frozen Stockholm morning. I bring with me a mild sunburn, a few souvenirs, and a great joy to be homeward-bound.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Eating on the Three Capes Track</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hike/cliff.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Jurassic dolerite cliffs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, on a trip home to Australia, I sat in a cafe with a friend who had just finished a walk I’d never heard of. “It’s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.threecapestrack.com.au/&quot;&gt;Three Capes Track&lt;/a&gt;, it’s brand new, and it’s amazing”, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spectacular nature shots on her phone were convincing, but so was everything she had to say about the less photogenic parts: a well-graded path, comfortable huts, excellent cooking facilities, well-stocked bookshelves, knowledgeable rangers. It sounded like the perfect hike for someone who enjoys beautiful &amp;amp; remote environments, but isn’t looking for an enormous physical &amp;amp; logistical challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid-year, I started planning to do the hike on my next trip back. I rounded up a couple of siblings and got us all booked in for a mid-January departure, finishing on my birthday. None of us are hugely experienced hikers. I’d done one recent 5 day hike in Sweden, and not much else since my teens. My siblings are regular day-hikers, but packing for a multi-dayer was something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I planned &amp;amp; prepared food for myself &amp;amp; one sibling (the other preferred to cook for herself). We are both omnivores, and I am currently under gluten-free orders (I still eat oats &amp;amp; am not strict on thickeners/starches/additives). We decided we were comfortable eating pasteurised cheese away from refrigeration for a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My packing strategy is zip-lock bags all the way down: huge ones containing lots of medium ones that contain lots of small ones. Each labelled, and representing a discrete meal, snack or object (what few clothes I take also go into zip-lock bags).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a breakfast bag, with the oats and the coffee sachets. We each carried our own lunch bag. Dinners were broken up into their own labelled zip-lock bags &amp;amp; we shared them between our packs. I didn’t weigh the food component of my bag separately, but my total bag weight at start was 11kg, including water- this was perfectly comfortable to carry, and dropped rapidly as we ate our way through the supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For eating, we each carried a camping bowl, a nifty silicon folding cup, a plastic fork and a plastic soup spoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food was sourced from Coles, Woolworths and a camping supply store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-capes-track-4-day3-night-gluten-free-hiking-menu&quot;&gt;Three Capes Track 4 day/3 night gluten-free hiking menu&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**: These are the things I wish I’d brought more of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;breakfast-coffee--oats&quot;&gt;Breakfast: Coffee &amp;amp; oats&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2x instant cappuccino sachet each per day. Total: 12 sachets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oats for 6 breakfasts&lt;/strong&gt; (all ingredients combined in a zip-loc bag):
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;300g gluten-free oats, blitzed in a blender in an attempt to make them smaller &amp;amp; more “instant”&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;2/3 a cup of milk powder&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;pinch salt&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1/2 cup coconut shreds- not the tiny ones used for baking, the bigger flakes from the health food section&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;1/3 cup each sliced &amp;amp; pitted dried dates, apricots &amp;amp; apples&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Planned preparation&lt;/em&gt;: Empty half a cup of mix into a bowl, pour boiling water over, stir for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Better preparation&lt;/em&gt;: Add two servings worth to a saucepan of boiling water, stir over heat for a minute or two until it softens &amp;amp; thickens to a nice porridge consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How was it?&lt;/em&gt;: It was OK, but to be honest trying to make instant oats out of the only gluten-free-labelled oats I could find in Australia, which were big chewy whole grains, was not a great success. Even after a go round the food processor, they didn’t cook through just by adding boiling water. If you’re not stuck in gluten-free land, this breakfast works much better with regular instant oats from the supermarket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lunch-tuna--crackers&quot;&gt;Lunch: Tuna &amp;amp; crackers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tin of tuna per person per day. Total: 6 tins of tuna&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 sachet of Kewpie mayonnaise, pinched from a Sushi Train restaurant, per day. Total: 3 sachets of mayonnaise**&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 packet of Mary’s Gone Crackers gluten-free seed crackers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 packet of regular crackers. Total: 2 packets of crackers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 carrot per person per day. Total: 6 carrots&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 Nutella snack thing per person per day. Total: 6 Nutella things&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 Mini Babybel cheese per person per day. Total: 6 mini cheeses**&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How was it?&lt;/em&gt;: It was awesome, except for the time we dropped a full, open can of tuna in a huge puddle of rainwater while perched on the edge of a cliff. Also, smallish whole carrots turn out to be great lunchtime snacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dinner-one-chicken-tom-yum-soup&quot;&gt;Dinner One: Chicken Tom Yum Soup&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 sachet of gourmet instant Tom Yum soup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 zip-lock bag containing 1/3 cup coconut milk powder + 1/2 packet of dehydrated peas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2x cans of springwater canned chicken, a delight yet unknown in Swedish supermarkets but readily available in Australia&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 single-serve bundles of rice vermicelli noodles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preparation&lt;/em&gt;: Empty contents of Tom Yum soup sachet &amp;amp; zip-lock bag into a saucepan with a bit of water. Bring to boil. Once peas are looking rehydrated, add vermicelli noodles &amp;amp; boil for a minute or so. Add cans of chicken &amp;amp; serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How was it?&lt;/em&gt;: Pretty good. The vermicelli noodles turned out a bit sludgey, and it would definitely have benefited from more vegetables than just peas, but the tom yum soup base &amp;amp; coconut milk were a tasty combo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dinner-two-beef-pad-thai&quot;&gt;Dinner Two: Beef Pad Thai&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 sachet of pad thai sauce&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 zip-lock bag containing 1/2 cup dehydrated peas + 1/2 cup dried shiitake mushrooms&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 packet of freeze-dried ground beef from the camping store- &lt;a href=&quot;http://backcountrycuisine.co.nz/bcc/index.php/archives/226&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 single-serve bundles of rice vermicelli noodles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preparation&lt;/em&gt;: Bring a saucepan of water to boil. Pour some over vermicelli noodles in a separate saucepan or bowl to cook. To the remaining hot water, add ground beef &amp;amp; contents of zip-lock bag. Leave until beef &amp;amp; veggies are rehydrated, around 10 minutes. Drain excess water if it hasn’t been absorbed. Drain vermicelli noodles, add to saucepan with meat &amp;amp; veggies, add pad thai sauce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How was it?&lt;/em&gt;: Meh. I didn’t road test the pad thai mix before the hike, and I wouldn’t have taken it along if I had. It was kind of bland and sweet. Was also pretty sick of rice vermicelli noodles at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dinner-three-beef--bean-quinoa-chilli&quot;&gt;Dinner Three: Beef &amp;amp; bean quinoa chilli&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 packet of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/cooksimple-Natural-Cowboy-Quinoa-Cinnamon/dp/B00ABLM0JM?th=1&quot;&gt;this quinoa &amp;amp; dehydrated bean mix that I found in the gluten-free aisle at Woolworths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 sachet of tomato paste&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 packet of freeze-dried ground beef&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preparation&lt;/em&gt;: Put in saucepan with ground beef 3 cups of water, simmer for about 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How was it?&lt;/em&gt;: It was really, really tasty. It takes longer to cook than I’d like for camping food, which was fine for this particular walk as you’re not carrying gas canisters or trying to cook on a wobbly rock (it might be a good candidate for “add boiling water to insulated container” type cooking). It had some mildly undesireable intestinal consequences in the following days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trailmix&quot;&gt;Trailmix&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I hike, I prepare a small zip-lock bag per day of customised trail-mix. For this hike, each bag contained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sultanas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Peanuts, roasted &amp;amp; salted&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Almonds, roasted &amp;amp; unsalted&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cashews, honey-roasted&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Crunchy chickpeas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skittles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choc-coated sultanas &amp;amp; peanuts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 &lt;a href=&quot;http://gingerpeople.com/gin-gin-candies.html&quot;&gt;gin-gin&lt;/a&gt; per day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How was it?&lt;/em&gt;: So, so good. Finished the bag every day. Converted one sibling to a total gin-gin fiend, and formed a skittle-based market economy within the group by day 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;extras&quot;&gt;Extras&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A wheel of cheap supermarket brie &amp;amp; a handful of crackers for celebrating our arrival at the first hut. This was an excellent idea &amp;amp; one I heartily recommend&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tea bags, a handful of assorted. Should have brought way more, as long afternoons in the huts really suit a nice cup of tea&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Small zip-lock of milk powder. For the tea, but wound up being combined with Nutella &amp;amp; hot water to make ‘hot chocolate’. Obviously should have brought hot chocolate sachets also&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Half a packet of gluten-free shortbread, to go with the tea&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Six mini cupcakes my friend baked for me, which I saved until my birthday&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A lil 50ml bottle of whisky for toasting the eve of my birthday&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A couple of strips of homemade jerky, a gift from a sibling who wasn’t able to join us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hike/wallaby.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Boardwalk&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cooking--eating-in-australias-fanciest-hiker-huts&quot;&gt;Cooking &amp;amp; eating in Australia’s fanciest hiker huts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitchen facilities on the trail are excellent, but it can get crowded, so it’s still a good idea to plan for minimum prep and cooking time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitchens don’t have knives, so if you’re packing something you need to chop up, bring your own knife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitchens do have sinks with running water and drains, spaghetti strainers, vegetable peelers, fry pans, saucepans and many other luxuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll carry out all your own trash (bar what you decide you can reasonably put in the tiny food scrap bins), so take off all extra layers of packaging before you go, and bring trash bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you don’t have to carry a full load of camping gear, there is some delightful scope for carrying luxuries (like wheels of brie, fresh vegetables, and birthday cupcakes). I’d still recommend going for a minimum food weight menu, and make those luxuries count, because the lighter your pack, the happier you’ll be, all the way along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were days when I carried way more water than it turned out I needed- I really didn’t need 2L for the 5km track on the first day. Knowing that you can refill your water each time you pass a hut, think carefully about how much you really need at a time. The only day I needed my full 2L capacity was on the last day, which is 17km without opportunities to refill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gift shop at Port Arthur before you leave has a small selection of specialist hiking food. It’s too expensive &amp;amp; last-minute to plan on using it as your main food supply, but they have some stuff like packets of dehydrated mixed vegetables which would make an excellent addition to a menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track is every bit as thoughtfully produced as my friend had raved about, and it absolutely lives up to the hype of a multi-day hike for people who want to see some of Tasmania’s most stunning wilderness without needing masses of experience and equipment. If I were to do it again, I’d avoid going in the school holidays (the beautiful wooden eco-lodges turn into giant xylophones with the constant thudding of all those little feet on the boardwalks), I’d take my knitting for whiling away the long afternoons in the huts, and I’d do each day’s walks at a much slower pace. It’s a truly spectacular stretch of coastline, and knowing that you’ll have somewhere warm and dry to cook your dinner and sleep at the end of each day, the luxury of taking it easy should be enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>In which I remember the existence of rel=noopener only after I finally go live</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After six months or so mouldering on my hard drive, I remembered that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This site exists&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I own this domain name&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WTF Ali just put it up already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let us all rejoice, I did it. And then, I caught this reminder on Twitter just as I was pushing this site live:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;TIL target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; attribute on a link without  rel=&amp;quot;noopener&amp;quot; could allow a phishing attack....&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JmWhaiGLxI&quot;&gt;https://t.co/JmWhaiGLxI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/FrontEndDeveloper?src=hash&quot;&gt;#FrontEndDeveloper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dana Giordano (@smallspark) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/smallspark/status/768908206395445248&quot;&gt;August 25, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And oh, oops! I had indeed given those lovely Instagram photos in the footer of my page new window openings with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;target=_blank&lt;/code&gt;, without doing the necessary cleansing of the opener reference. Without removing the new window’s knowledge of the original window, it would be easy to change the original window to something fraudulent and nefarious. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;www.alihaberfield.evil-spy-twin.com&lt;/code&gt;, for example, which would look exactly like this but be made to steal your identity rather than showcase my tech opinions and photos of spiders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;http://instagram.com/me/my_glorious_photo&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;target=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;_blank&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   	Dangerous link :( :(
   &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I needed to do to fix it up was change it to something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;http://instagram.com/me/my_glorious_photo&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;target=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;_blank&quot;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
   	Safer link :) :)
   &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you go, closing one particularly glaring and obvious hole in this leaking privacy and security disaster we call the internet is as easy as throwing some extra junk into your markup, which is probably about as free &amp;amp; easy as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Post Zero</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With this complete date &amp;amp; timestamp, the post fails to build:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot; data-lang=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt; 
   &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;2016-04-07 16:35:11&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I remove the timestamp, or if I set the date to yesterday but leave the timestamp intact, it builds as expected. These both build:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot; data-lang=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;2016-04-06 16:35:11&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;2016-04-07&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curious.&lt;/p&gt;
